*Operatin System Task*

Simulate a shell that accepts DOS commands and displays the output (results):
Example: when user writes “dir”, the shell runs “ls” command. Note: you 
have to use external text file for mapping between Linux and DOS 
commands.

Required for the task
• Menu Interface
The task has to provide a menu interface to let the user picks the option he
wants.
The task should not be closed after executing only one option, instead the 
menu has to re-appear until the user picks exit.
• Manual Page
You have to implement the manual page for your task, so for example if the 
task name is task3, when the user types “man task3” in the terminal, the 
manual page for your task should appear.

 General Instructions
• You will implement one of the following scheduling algorithms (just 
simulation) with any programming language.
• GUI is a must and has a big part of the score (Gantt Chart must be 
provided).
• Number of processes should be user defined (i.e. user enters them at run 
time). 
• All process data (i.e. process arrival time, burst time) must be user defined.
• Validation for the input data must be considered (i.e. can’t enter negative 
numbers, or characters in the input fields). 
• Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, and Response Time for each process should 
be calculated. 
• Average Waiting Time, Average Turnaround Time, and Average Response 
Time should be calculated.
